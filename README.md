# 🍽️ Zomato Business Insights – Data Analysis Project #
📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato to uncover actionable business insights. The analysis helps stakeholders understand customer preferences, pricing strategies, service trends, and popular locations in the food delivery and dine-out industry.

✅ Key Business Insights
💸 Pricing Strategy:
Most restaurants charge between ₹200–₹500 for two people, making this the sweet spot for pricing.

🌟 Rating Analysis:
There is no strong correlation between pricing and customer ratings, indicating that customer satisfaction isn't always tied to price.

🍴 Service Type Trends:
Delivery and Dine-out are the most dominant service types, suggesting a shift toward convenience-focused dining.

🛵 Online Ordering Behavior:
Restaurants in the mid-price range tend to offer online ordering, indicating a potential for volume-driven revenue.

🍜 Popular Cuisines:
North Indian and Chinese cuisines dominate the menu offerings across the dataset.

📍 Hotspot Locations:
Neighborhoods like BTM, Koramangala, and Whitefield have a high density of restaurants, making them prime areas for new business opportunities.
